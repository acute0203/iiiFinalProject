This is my Final Project at III

1.	The main codes that I execute on spark are "emotionplotmachinelearning.py" and "indexplotmail.py" .It was training by emotion dictionary. Another training system is base on sparse matrix. The codes are in "chi_square_test.py" and "machine_learning.py"
2.	"emotionCount" is a mapreduce code which can training on hadoop.
3.  You can check system architecture and result in "Project_G2_1028mac pdf.pdf".
4.  The other codes are my testing code. So you can check similar paragraph in "emotionplotmachinelearning.py" , "indexplotmail.py", "chi_square_test.py" and "machine_learning.py"

1. "Crawer.py" is the code that can get immediately stock price and can clean by itself.it is executed by crontab with 
"shell script".
2. "Ngram code in shell --scala code" is the code that can make Ngram on spark.

Thanks for your visited! This is my first time coding on spark and hadoop! If you have any opinion about the code please write me an e-mail! acute0203@gmail.com
