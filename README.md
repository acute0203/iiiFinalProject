iiiFinalProject
===============

This is my Final Project at III

1.	The main codes that I execute on spark are “emotionplotmachinelearning.py” and “indexplotmail.py” .It was training by emotion dictionary. Another training system is base on sparse matrix. The codes are in “chi_square_test.py” and “machine_learning.py”
2.	“emotionCount” is a mapreduce code which can training on hadoop.
3.  You can check system architecture and result in “Project_G2_1028mac pdf.pdf”.
4.  The other codes are my testing code. So you can check similar paragraph in “emotionplotmachinelearning.py” , “indexplotmail.py” , chi_square_test.py and machine_learning.py
5.  Thanks for your visited! This is my first time coding on spark and hadoop! If you have any opinion about the code please write me an e-mail! acute0203@gmail.com
